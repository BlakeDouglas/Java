Create a BMI calculator that reads the user’s weight and height (providing an option for the user to select which formula to use), 
and then calculates and displays the user’s body mass index. Also, display the BMI categories and their values from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute: 
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm (Links to an external site.) 
so the user can evaluate his/her BMI.
